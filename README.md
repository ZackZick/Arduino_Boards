# Arduino_Boards

Resources for Arduino boards and related stuff. 

The following items are available:
- Eagle library for Inhaos Uno-Core
- Eagle library for Inhaos Mega2560-Core

The Mega2560-Core has been tested, the circuit board seems correct.
Note that the Uno-Core board version from July 2017 had mirrored pins, making it useless! It was corrected 2017-08-26.

You are welcome to contribute with for example alternative fotprints etc.
